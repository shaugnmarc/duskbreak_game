WARNING: This file involves foul language. Please exercise responsibility, discretion and empathy if accessing this reference material. Its technical purpose does not indicate support or spread of real-world usage.

This file contains a list of terms used solely for automated moderation checks during the username input process. Its presence facilitates technical screening functions, not endorsement of stances.

While certain references allow neutral validation, we must remember their sensitivity. Complex realities mean restrictions may always be needed to some degree. Through cooperation and understanding and focusing on positive progress daily, perhaps one day such guidelines can evolve with the times to promote greater inclusion wherever possible.

As developers, our work directly shapes experiences, so care and discretion are key. I want to allow players to use their desired usernames for the leaderboard, but I still want to ensure sensitivity among all communities. Other words in this list are straight up bad and as much as I want freedom of expression to be present in the game, I have to set some limits. 

Unnoticed filtered words are going to be privately deleted from the leaderboards if they every pass through the filtering process.









## PLEASE CONTACT ME IF YOU REALLY NEED THE FULL LIST SINCE I HAVE REMOVED IT FOR THE PUBLIC EYE ##
